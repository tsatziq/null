*** OVERVIEW ***
A simple text editor with clipboard created for a introductory programming class. Probably still very buggy because it has only been tested properly with one Ubuntu laptop. Please understand.

*** MAIN INTERFACE ***
The program consists of four main parts: ITEM LIST, the MAIN FRAME, the ITEM VIEWER, and the COMMAND LINE.

1. ITEM LIST: 
You can save parts of the text in the main box in here for later use. Please see COMMANDS below for the commands and shortcuts. Select items to show them in the ITEM VIEWER.

2. MAIN FRAME:
The main text editing frame. You can save parts of this to the ITEM LIST and use them later. You can save the file to the folder the program is run from, and open files. 

3. ITEM VIEWER:
Displays saved items selected in the ITEM LIST. Editing and selecting disabled.

4. COMMAND LINE:
The main commands related to the programs functions are typed here. Most commands can also be executed with keyboard shortcuts.
